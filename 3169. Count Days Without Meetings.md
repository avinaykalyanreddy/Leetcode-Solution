# 3169. Count Days Without Meetings


You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

Note: The meetings may overlap.


## Aproach 

1. Sort the meeting based on the starting
2. Merge the all the overlapping intervals 
3. use the formula days = days - ((end+1)) - start) because to find number of days to find meeting was held.
4. return the days

```python
class Solution:
    def countDays(self, days: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
                
        meetings.sort(key=lambda a: a[0])

        merge = [meetings[0]]

        for i in range(1,len(meetings)):

            start,end = meetings[i]

            if start <= merge[-1][1]:
                if end > merge[-1][1]:
                    merge[-1][1] = end

            else:

                merge.append([start,end])

    
        for i in merge:

            cal = (i[1]+1) - i[0]

            days -= cal
        return (days)

```

## Space complexity --> O(n)
