# 2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid

You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.

A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return -1.

## Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, grid: List[List[int]], x: int) -> int:
        

            arr = []

            for i in grid:

                for k in i:

                    arr.append(k)
            arr.sort()


            val = arr[(len(arr)-1)//2]

            res = 0

            for i in arr:

                j = abs(val-i)

                if j % x == 0:

                    res += j//x
                else:

                    return (-1)
            return (res)

```
