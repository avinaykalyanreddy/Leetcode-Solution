## 💡 Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. A **subarray** is called **good** if it contains **at least `k` pairs** of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

Return the **total number of good subarrays** in the array.

## ✅ Approach (Sliding Window + Hash Map)

We use a **sliding window** approach to efficiently keep track of pairs and count good subarrays.

### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. We maintain a window using two pointers: `l` (left) and `i` (right).
2. Use a frequency dictionary `dic` to track how many times each number appears in the current window.
3. For each element `nums[i]`, calculate how many new pairs it contributes by doing:
   ```python
   pairs += dic[nums[i]]
4. If the number of pairs in the window is at least k, then every subarray starting from l and ending at or after i is valid. So, we add (len(nums) - i) to the result.

5. Shrink the window from the left (l += 1) and reduce the pair count accordingly.

6. Repeat this process for each index in the array.


```
   nums = [3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4]
   k = 2
```
# Output: 4

```python
class Solution:
    def countGood(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        dic = {}
        res = l = pairs = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in dic:
                dic[nums[i]] = 0

            pairs += dic[nums[i]]
            dic[nums[i]] += 1

            while pairs >= k:
                res += len(nums) - i
                dic[nums[l]] -= 1
                pairs -= dic[nums[l]]
                l += 1

        return res


```

⌛ Time and Space Complexity  

Time Complexity: O(n) — Each element is added and removed from the window at most once.

Space Complexity: O(n) — For storing frequencies in the hash map.
