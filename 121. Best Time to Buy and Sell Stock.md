You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Approach

* In while traversing, find the min value
* if current val greater than min value then min_value - current_value
* if current val is less than min_value then update the min_value

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices) -> int:
        
        min_value = float("inf")
        max_profit = 0
        
        for  i in prices:
            
            if i < min_value:
                
                min_value = i
                
            else:
                
                max_profit = max(max_profit,i-min_value)
                
        return max_profit

```
