# 191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I

You are given a binary array nums.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.
Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.


```python

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums):
        
        res = 0
        
        def flip(nums,i):
            
            if nums[i] == 0:
                
                nums[i] = 1
                
            else:
                nums[i] = 0
                
        
        for i in range(len(nums)-2):
            
            if nums[i] == 0:
                
                flip(nums,i)
                flip(nums,i+1)
                flip(nums,i+2)
                
                res += 1
                
        if not nums[-1] or not nums[-2]:
            
            return -1
        
        return res

```

# Time complexity O(n)

# Space complexity O(1)
