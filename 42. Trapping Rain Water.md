### Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

```

## Algorithm

1. Initialize Two Arrays:
    * Create an empty list left to store the maximum height on the left of each bar.  
    * Create an empty list right to store the maximum height on the right of each bar.  

2. Calculate Right Maximum Heights:
    * Traverse the height list from right to left:  
        * If the right list is empty, add the current height with its index.
        * If the current height is greater than or equal to the last height in the right list, add it.

3. Initialize the Result:
    * Set res (result) to 0.

4. Calculate Left Maximum Heights and Water Trapped:
    * Traverse the height list from left to right:  
        * If the left list is empty, add the current height.
        * If the current height is greater than the last height in left, add it.
        * While the current index is greater than the last index in right, remove the last element from right.
        * Calculate the minimum of the last heights in left and right as the limiting height. 
        * Subtract the current height from this limiting height and add the result to res.

5. Return the Result:

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = []

        right = []

        for i in range(len(height)-1,-1,-1):

            if not right :

                right.append((height[i],i))

            elif height[i] >= right[-1][0]:

                right.append((height[i],i))

        res = 0

        for i in range(len(height)):
            
            if not left:
                
                left.append(height[i])
                
            if height[i] > left[-1]:
                
                left.append(height[i])
                
            
            while i > right[-1][1]:
                
                right.pop()
                
            l = left[-1]
            r = right[-1][0]
            
            res = res+(min(l,r)-height[i])
            
        return (res)
```
