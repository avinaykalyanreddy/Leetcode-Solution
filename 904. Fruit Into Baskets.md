# 904. Fruit Into Baskets


You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.


## Algorithm
1. Initialize Variables:  
    * res → stores the final maximum number of fruits picked.
    * cur → stores the current count of fruits in the current window.
    * dic → dictionary to store count of each fruit type in the current window.
    * left → left pointer of the sliding window

2. Define Helper Function solving():  
    * While the number of fruit types in dic is more than 2:
        * Decrease the count of the fruit at position left.
        * Decrement cur because we're shrinking the window
        * If the count of that fruit becomes zero, remove it from dic
        * Move the left pointer to the right.

3. Iterate Over the fruits Array with Index i:
    * If the fruit type at index i is not in dic, initialize its count to 0.
    * Increment the count of the fruit at index i in dic.
    * If the number of fruit types exceeds 2, call solving() to shrink the window.
    * Increment cur because we’ve added one more fruit to the window.
    * Update res with the maximum of res and cur.

4. Return res as the maximum number of fruits you can collect.



```python
fruits = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3]





res = 0
cur = 0

dic = {}

left = 0


def solving():
    global left, cur

    while len(dic) > 2:

        if dic[fruits[left]] != 0:
            dic[fruits[left]] -= 1
            cur = cur - 1

        if dic[fruits[left]] == 0:
            del dic[fruits[left]]

        left += 1


for i in range(len(fruits)):

    if fruits[i] not in dic:
        dic[fruits[i]] = 0

    dic[fruits[i]] += 1

    if len(dic) > 2:
        solving()

    cur = cur + 1

    res = max(res, cur)

print(res)
```
