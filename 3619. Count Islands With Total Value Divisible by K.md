# 3619. Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

You are given an m x n matrix grid and a positive integer k. An island is a group of positive integers (representing land) that are 4-directionally connected (horizontally or vertically).

The total value of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

Return the number of islands with a total value divisible by k.


```python
grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]]; k = 3




n = len(grid)
m = len(grid[0])
res = 0
def tracking(i,j):

    if 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m and grid[i][j] > 0:

        x = grid[i][j]

        grid[i][j] = 0

        return x + tracking(i+1,j) + tracking(i-1,j) + tracking(i,j+1) + tracking(i,j-1)

    return 0


for i in range(n):

    for j in range(m):


        if grid[i][j] > 0 :

            val = tracking(i,j)

            if val % k == 0:

                res += 1

print(res)
```
